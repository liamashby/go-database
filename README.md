The aim of this project is two-fold:

1. Build from scratch the basic functionality of a database. Heavily inspired by [link]()
2. Become more familiar with go, go testing, go standard library etc.

(Initial) components:

1. A way to store data on disk
-  Data stored in one file
-  A few columns, of different types (int, str, date)

2. A way to query that data on disk using a cli


(Eventual) components:

1. Optimising storage by adding indexes
2. Create an API layer
